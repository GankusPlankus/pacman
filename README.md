# 1.1 Pac Man

# 1.2 
This is the pacman assignment for MIT's MERN STACK course

# 1.3 
This assignment uses a javascript code that utilizes html to execute an image of pac man eating its way across the screen with each click. Upon reaching the edge of the screen, it turns around and starts over. There are four images of pac man in total, with its mouth open, closed, and a reverse direction of the two. The images are currently missing from this file. 

# 1.4 
This code is located here for the purpose of an eventual portfolio, showcasing the ability to utilize functions, objects, and if-else statements as well as map object properties via an html file. 

# 1.5 
Currently there are no plans to add to this code aside from the aforementioned Pac Man images. 

# 1.6 
This project may include collaboration, but for the time being will be inactive by the author (Gankus Plankus).
