# 1.1 Pac Man

pacman assignment for MIT's MERN STACK course

This assignment uses a javascript code that utilizes html to execute an image of pac man eating its way across the screen with each click. Upon reaching the edge of the screen, it turns around and starts over. There are four images of pac man in total, with its mouth open, closed, and a reverse direction of the two. The images are currently missing from this file.
